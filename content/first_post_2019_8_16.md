Summary: This post will hold myself accountable for why I created
this website, and what I hope to do in the next several months.

I am setting out to create my own personal website! Yes I could have just
made a WordPress site, but I wanted to also get better at web development.

This website will be built in Pelican, but also will be the starting off point for my
future educational blog posts.

From here, I hope I can get more involved in deeper educational analysis, as
well as deeper web development.
